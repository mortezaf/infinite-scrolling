## Infinite Scrolling with Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

This JavaScript code provides functionality for infinite scrolling with dynamic threshold adjustment based on scrolling speed. It's suitable for implementing infinite scrolling in web applications where data needs to be loaded as the user scrolls through content.

### Features
- Infinite scrolling with dynamic threshold adjustment for efficient data loading.
- Simulated API data fetching to demonstrate functionality.
- Classifies device screen size to adjust fetching aggressiveness.

### Usage
1. Include this JavaScript code in your web application.

2. Ensure you have an HTML structure similar to the provided classes for `.container`, `.loading-container`, `.result-container`, and `.device-info`.

3. Adjust the `simulateApiData` function to fetch actual data from your API.

4. Customize the `fetchData` function according to your data processing requirements.

### Note
- This code uses simulated API data for demonstration purposes. Replace `simulateApiData` with actual API calls in your application.
- Adjust the threshold values and scrolling speed conditions based on your application's requirements.

### Dependencies
